#Create two integer variables called num1 and num2 and assign them your favorite numbers.
#Next, compute the sum, difference, quotient, product, and modulus of these two numbers 
#and assign these values to variables called sum, difference, quotient, product, and modulus, respectively.
#For the quotient, be sure to convert the variables to Floats before dividing.

num1 = 33
num2 = 4

sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
quotient = num1.to_f / num2.to_f
product = num1 * num2
modulus = num1 % num2

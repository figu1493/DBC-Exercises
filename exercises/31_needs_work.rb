#Create an RPNCalculator class which can evaluate expressions 
#written in Reverse Polish notation.

#It should have an evaluate instance method which takes as its 
#input a valid RPN expression and returns its evaluation. 
#Your calculator only needs to handle addition, multiplication, 
#and subtraction (not division).

#Operators and numbers should be separated by a single space.

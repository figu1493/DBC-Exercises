# Write a method that will sing the song "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall". It should take an integer for a parameter to tell it which verse to start with.

# Each verse should print to the console in a format like this:

# <n> bottles of beer on the wall
# <n> bottles of beer
# Take one down, pass it around
# <n - 1> bottles of beer on the wall
# where <n> is the current number of bottles of beer on the wall.

# The last line should read No more bottles of beer on the wall :/.
